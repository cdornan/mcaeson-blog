subtl: types as deriving configurations

Coding in modern Haskell can be a matter of modelling the problem domain with
`data` and `newtype` declarations, then `deriving` the systems needed to
assemble the application, possibly with `TemplateHaskell`.

Originally the mechanism was used strictly for generating instances for a few
`Prelude` classes, but with the development of generics has become a structuring
mechanism for building packages and applications.

How cool is that!

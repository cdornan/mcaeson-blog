I have been having fun with the new blog but I have been thinking how to
organise things going forward. Apart from general topics I have
decided to write some notes under three headings:

  * [**Language Extensions**](/pages/extension-reviews.html) like `{-# LANGUAGE
    OverloadedStrings #-}`.

  * [**Packages**](/pages/package-reviews.html) like `fmt` and `hakyll`.

  * [**Structutes**](/pages/structure-reviews.html) like `Functor`,
    `Applicative` and `Monad`.

The idea is to write the kind of notes that I would have appreciated starting
out and will find useful going forward.

Each review gets a star rating because otherwise where would be the fun in that?
I don't expect to be writing any one or two star reviews; three stars represents
a good subject, four for excellence, five for outstanding and six stars for a
game changer. Especially where packages are concerned I will critique and make
suggestions but have no general interest in writing negative reviews.

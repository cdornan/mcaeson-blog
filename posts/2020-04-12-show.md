title: Show Offs
subtl: When to derive Show?
issue: 17
---

The first Haskell system I used was
[Gofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gofer_(programming_language)) which
allowed anything to be shown. At some point its successor,
[Hugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugs) switched to the proper Haskell system
where the appropriate instances of the `Show` class are needed to show anything.

Ever since I have religiously derived Show instance for almost all types so that
I can see them in the REPL.

I am not alone, but also clearly not everyone agrees. Some packages export types
that do not have `Show` instances necessitating their derivation for simple REPL
use in non-library contexts. For library contexts they will have to be wrapped
in a `newtype` first.

Being ever so selfish and narrow minded I am inclined to feel that maybe the
`Show` instances should be derived at source, but I am not sure whether this is
reasonable. Are folks not deriving the Show types in case someone should think
they are making use of the REPL, the [Stupid
Haskellers'](/posts/2020-03-29-stupid.html) prop?

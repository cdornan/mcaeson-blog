title: Good Package Documentation
subtl: is hard to write, really hard
issue: 31

If you have not read William Yao's brilliant [Reanimate: swearing at bad
documentation](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-05-10-reanimate-an-experience-report.html)
from last month I wholeheartedly recommend it. In it William describes his own
difficulties trying to understand the documentation of a remarkable and capable
package. It will be an experience familiar to all Haskellers yet so little has
been written about this. We need more of this.

Writing good package documentation is hard, really hard, but there seem to be
particular pitfalls when it comes to writing good Haskell package documentation,
which seem to be related to the relatively high levels of abstractions that
Haskell package authors tend to favour.

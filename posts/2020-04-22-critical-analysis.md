Listening to today's excellent [Bunker
podcast](https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker/16a84583-f109-475b-be46-1500d3e36223)
(which I can't recommend highly enough) I was gripped by their discussion of how
cults (groups that insist that 5G transmitters cause COVID-19, etc.) are always
careful to build in reality protection mechanisms whereby anybody asking
questions is confirmation of the conspiracy.

This all used to be for the cranks but is now becoming, it seems, almost
mainstream, and it is pretty obvious that this trend is being fuelled by social
media, allowing people to park up in echo chambers that reinforce whatever
narrative is binding the group together &mdash; that alongside the declining
powers of the traditional news media.

I think the eroding of the authority of the print media started with the 2003
war in Iraq when we were all lied to &mdash; or lied to ourselves &mdash; with
the failure of the classic news sources to ask the questions they should have
been asking. I just happened to be paying attention to the right sources so
nothing surprised me, even a tiny little bit. I certainly believed that the days
of receiving our opinions and information from the traditional sources, at least
without checking them against specialist sources, were dead. I welcomed the rise
of the independent bloggers, and joined them myself (in a small way).

Be careful what you wish for.

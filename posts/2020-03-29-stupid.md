subtl: Stupid is seriously undervalued by Haskellers

Welcome to my blog where I plan to write mostly about developing software in
Haskell &mdash; which I have been doing on and off for these past 33 years
(since it was called
[Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)) indeed.)


## Why <i>The Stupid Haskeller</i>?

Haskellers are famously into clever, mathematical abstractions, and let's be
candid, are tempted to think of ourselves, collectively, as frightfully
clever. Maybe the infamous learning curve required to get started in
Haskell reflects this (but surely reflects many other things).

I have a pet thesis that this love of cleverness is actually quite stupid
because a community that does not have deep-pocketed backers will only thrive if
_many_ people use it. But everybody knows that the world is predominantly made
up of us stupid fellows, relative to the really clever.

I think us stupid folks have been a little neglected by the Haskell community,
much to our detriment, and one of the things I would like to do with this blog
is explore this important topic.

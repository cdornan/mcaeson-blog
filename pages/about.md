This is my personal blog where I generally write about
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) development, and (perhaps) some other
things.

I work for IRIS Connect where I helped to develop their video platform
which makes extensive use of Haskell in its back end (the web app being built
on Rails).

I also work as a volunteer curator on [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/) and
write Haskell in my spare time.

If you need to drop me a line my contact details are in the footer, below.
